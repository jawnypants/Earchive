This directory contains ready-to-share bundles for the **Earchive of the Alternate Present** workstation.

- `Earchive_site.zip` – Static site bundle (HTML, CSS, JS, assets, and soundfonts) ready to host.
- `Earchive_project.zip` – Full project source (site files, assets, docs, and tests) in one archive.

If you regenerate these bundles, ensure both contain the Fluidsynth WASM assets and the `assets/Scala Archive` tunings so the app works offline.
